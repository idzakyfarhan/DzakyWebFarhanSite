									</header>
									<p>Cibubur its lovely place for people around bogor,bekasi,jakarta and depok. it may confuse many people sometimes because it is located between 4 cities. but my house is located in Bogor near kota wisata and it is very small residence called Taman Kenari Nusantara.</p>

												<h3>Places to visit</h3>
											</header>
											<p>There are some interesting places located in Cibubur. if you would like to visit Mall to go shopping or just meeting/hanging out with my friends theres a big one called Trans Studio Mall Cibubur. it is open in 2019 and there are few apartments located near the mall and theres a theme park on top of the mall and one of the biggest theme park located in mall in indonesia. but if you just want to have a dinner with your friends or your lovely ones you could visit Mall Ciputra Cibubur because it is less crowded than Trans Studio Mall. Although it doesnt have many shopping places but you could have a peace dinner with your lovely ones there. my favourite place to go while in Ciputra is Sushi Tei.</p>

												<h3>My School</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My school located in Cibubur region Jakarta. My elementary is Al-Azhar 20 Islamic School, My Junior High School is also Al-Azhar 19 Islamic School. and my sweetheart place "Highschool" is Public School of 99. I left my highschool with many meaningful and sorrowful. Although, i my highschool times were cut off because of the Covid-19 but 2018-2020 early its a very good times for me and i could not replace those times with anything. If only i could sell or turn anything to go back to those times i would not hesitated to do that. Because of my friends, the teacher and my gang called Jupe its a very meaningful time for me. Like those times when i skipped the school for a day just for hanging out with my friends hahaha. i wish i could spare more time living in my high school.Also i am not forgetting my Junior Highschool gang that is Sagapung and KRVST. i really miss hanging out with them because i always spent my time with them but now i could not because we already seperated in many cities</p>
